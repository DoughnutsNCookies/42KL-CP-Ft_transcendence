PongSH is a web application that offers 42 students the experience of playing modern Pong.

The app includes additional features like friend management and chat functionality. 

With a terminal theme design, PongSH brings a nostalgic touch to the gaming interface, appealing to both retro and contemporary gaming enthusiasts.

This project took us two and a half months to learn everything and to create PongSH from scratch.
